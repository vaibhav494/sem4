Q1. What is Struts?
- Struts is an open source framework which makes building web applications easier. 
- Based on JSP and Java Servlets 
- Struts makes it easier to develop and maintain the web application 

Q2. What is a web framework?
- Web Framework is a ready made underlying structure, where you just need to add components necessary for your business
- Eg: Struts comes with all the jars that you might need to develop basic request and response cycle, and with basic configurations. 
- It provides controller servlet which reads all your request and convert it to integer or float according to the business needs. 
- If any exception occurs during this, you don’t have to deal with it. The framework deals with the particular exception. 
- After all conversions, the framework automatically gathers all the data needed from form to Java objects. You don’t have to right much code to validate any form either, the struts framework provides some basic automatic validations. 
- Framework also forces the team to implement their code in a standard way
- Framework might also help you in developing complex UI easily like iterating tables, menu, etc


Q3. What are the advantages of Struts?
- Open source: Free to develop and deploy since it’s open source web framework
- Tag Libraries: Struts provide a rich set of tag libraries, including tags for forms, HTML, logic, etc. These tags simplify the development of JSP pages and reduces the need for writing JAVA code in JSP file.
- Easy to debug: Struts framework makes it very easy to test and debug your code
- Extensibility: Struts is highly extensible, allowing developers to extend or replace its core components
- Large community support: Being one of the oldest frameworks, struts has a large and active community that provides a lot of support. 
- Form Beans: Struts uses form beans to represent forms. Form beans simplify data transfer from HTML form to Java objects, making it easier to validate and process form data. 
- Struts Tiles: The struts tiles framework allows developers to create layouts that can be reused across different parts of application making it easier to make a consistent look


Q4. Features of Struts
- Easy to debug: Strut frameworks added features, makes it easier to test and debug your code 
- Supports different presentation implementations(JSP, XML/XSLT, etc)
- Supports a different model implementation (JavaBeans, EJB, etc)
- Struts is based on JSP, Servlet, XML, and Java
- Configurable MVC component: Struts provides all component information in struts.xml file. If we need to change any information, we can simply to do it by changing the xml file
- POJO based action: In struts, the action class is POJO(Plain Old Java Object), i.e. a simple Java class. Hence, you are not forced to implement any interface or inherit any class
- Supports javas WORA (Write once, run anywhere) philosophy

Q5. Explain in detail struts Model 1
        Model 1 Architecture
- Servlet and JSP are the main technologies used to develop web application
- Presentation and business logic are messed up

1. Browser sends request for JSP page
2. JSP access Java Bean and invokes business logic
3. Java Bean connects to the database to get/save data 
4. Response is sent to the browser which is generated by JSP 
Advantages 
* Easy and Quick to develop web application 
Disadvantage
* Navigation control is decentralised 
* Time consuming
* Hard to extend hence good for small applications but not large

Q6. Explain in detail struts model 2 architecture

Advantages
* Navigation control is centralised
* Easy to maintain
* Easy to test
* Easy to extend
* Better separation of concerns
Disadvantages
* We need to write the controller code by ourself. If we change, the controller code, we need to recompile the class and redeploy the application 

Q7. What is value stack and what are its methods?
* A valueStack is simply a stack that contains application specific objects such as action object and other model object
* At the execution time, action object is placed on top. 
* We can put objects in valueStack, query it and delete it
Methods
1. public String findString(String expr) : finds the string by evaluating the given expression
2. public Object findValue(String expr) : finds the value by evaluating the specified expression
3. public Object findValue(String expr, Class c) : finds the value by evaluating the specified expression
4. public Object peek(): returns the object  located on top of stack
5. public Object pop() : returns the object located on top of stack and removes it
6. public void push(Object o) : puts the object on top of stack
7. public int size() : returns the number of objects from stack


Q8. What is JSON Object Syntax 
* Unordered sets of name/value pair
* Begins with { 
* Ends with } 
* Each name is followed by :
* Name/value pairs are separated by , 
* Eg:   
        var employeeData = {
        “employee_id”: 123456,
        “employee_name”: “Aryan”,
        “Consultant”: true
       };

Q9. What is JSON Array Syntax 
* An ordered collection of values 
* Begins with [
* Ends with ]
* Name/value pairs are separated by ,
* Eg:
         var employeeData = {
        “employee_id”: 123456,
        “employee_name”: “Aryan”,
         “random_nums” : [1,736,23,09,2]
       };

Q10. Advantages of JSON 
* JSON has a very straightforward syntax 
* Easy to create and manipulate 
* Can be natively parsed in JavaScript using eval()
* Supported by all major JavaScript frameworks 
* Supported by most backend technologies 

Q11. Differentiate between JSON and XML 

JSON	XML
Data Oriented	Document Oriented 
JSON is less secure than XML	XML is more secure 
JSON is simple to read and write 	XML has more complex format 
Data Types: Arrays, number, Boolean, string	Data Type allowed is only string 
For AJAX applications, JSON is faster and easier 	XML is comparatively slow owing to it consuming more memory 


Q12. What is JSON?
* A lightweight text based data interchange format
* Completely language independent 
* Based on subset of JavaScript Programming Language 
* Easy to understand, manipulate and generate

Q13. What are some of the interceptors in Struts2?
1.  alias : Allows parameters to have different name aliases across requests 
2. Debugging: provides several different debugging screens to the developer 
3. create session: 
4. fileUpload: Facilitates easy file uploading
